Thank you for trying Splashy!

Features
========

What makes Splashy special over other boot-splash systems is:
  * There is NO need to patch the kernel
  * It supports millions of colors as well as alpha channels (transparency)
  * All resolutions are supported
  * It supports all the formats provided by directfb: jpg, png, gif, mpg, swf...
  * It run in user-space as any other application. So, it can be run at any time
    by simply typing "splashy" at the command prompt
  * initramfs support, which allows Splashy to run early at boot [See Initram File System below]
  * XML configuration
  * Multiple and easy to create themes
  * Lots of effects (animations, fade in/out, smooth progress, etc)
  * TrueType2 fonts support
  * And many other features...

Requirements
============

In order to start using Splashy you will need to have the following:
  * A video card
  * A kernel that supports framebuffers (directfb)
  * Splashy itself

In order to compile Splashy you will also need to have the following:
  * glib2
  * directfb 1.0.1 or later
  * libpng

Installation (Quick)
====================

1. Install Splashy as you normally would any other GNU source code (see INSTALL)

2. Add "splash vga=791 quiet" to the append= line on your bootloader configuration

  NOTE: For Grub, this is /boot/grub/menu.lst
  For lilo you need "vga=791" in its own line before the kernel stanzas, and add
  only "quiet splash" to append=
  Other bootloaders will use the same options, but they need to be passed
  differently. Check your bootloader's manual

3. Make sure that /etc/init.d/splashy is symlinked from
   /etc/rcS.d/S01splashy, or whatever the first script is when your computer boots.

4. For /etc/lsb-base-logging.sh to work, make sure that /lib/lsb/init-functions
   sources this file:
    $> cat /lib/lsb/init-functions | tail -2

    [ -e /etc/lsb-base-logging.sh ] && . /etc/lsb-base-logging.sh || true

5. Reboot and have fun!

Installation (Detailed)
=======================

1. Install Splashy as you normally would (see INSTALL)

2. Edit your bootloader's configuration file to set up the framebuffer mode:
  * In Grub, edit /boot/grub/menu.lst
    HINT: In Debian, look for "#kopt" and append vga=0x317 to it.  Then run
    update-grub. Other distros edit the kernel root= line appropriately
  * In lilo, edit /etc/lilo.conf
    HINT: Look for the default image= and edit append= by appending vga=0x317
    to it
  * In Quik, edit /etc/quik.conf and append vga=0x317 to the kernel argument
    line

If you use a different framebuffer driver, then you would need to tell the
kernel, through the kernel's parameters, to use that other driver. For example,
to use the radeonfb framebuffer driver:
  * Grub: #kopt: quiet video=radeonfb:1024x768-32@100
  * Lilo: append="quiet video=radeonfb:1024x768-32@100"
For intel i810 internal cards the lilo line would look like:
  append="video=i810fb:vram:2,xres:1024,yres:768,bpp:8,hsync1:30,hsync2:55, \
    vsync1:50,vsync2:85,accel,mtrr"

Splashy will support any video mode the framebuffer supports
The following is a table for the vide modes and their corresponding codes

                  640x480    800x600    1024x768       1280x1024       1600x1200
 256 colors (8b)    769        771         773            775             796
 32K colors (15b)   784        787         790            793             797
 64K colors (16b)   785        788         791            794             798
 16M colors (24b)   786        789         792            795             799

For example, for 1024x768 at 16bit (64K colors or "thousands of colors"), you
could pass an argument to the kernel like:
  vga=791
These values could be used in base16 (hexadecimal) also, like:
  vga=0x317

3. Make sure "scripts/splashy-update-progress-steps" is in /etc/init.d/splashy and 
   /etc/rcS.d/S01splashy symlink that points there

4. Copy scripts/lsb-base-logging.sh to /etc/ and make sure that /lib/lsb/init-functions
   sources this file:
    $> cat /lib/lsb/init-functions | tail -2

    [ -e /etc/lsb-base-logging.sh ] && . /etc/lsb-base-logging.sh || true

5. Reboot and have fun!

Installation (static)
====================

1. edit configure.ac and enable the options to include keyboard, imageprovider and font information for directfb-config
2. edit src/Makefile.am and use the flags for -all-static (already commented out) and make sure to comment out the regular library call
3. follow the regular installation instructions from above

Configuration
=============

Splashy's configuration file is /etc/splashy/config.xml

To know about it read it's man page: man splashy-config.xml

Initram File System
===================

In order to enable Splashy running early at the initramfs level, you need to
ensure the following:

1. Make sure that you edit /etc/default/splashy and set ENABLE_INITRAMFS= to 1
like:
  ENABLE_INITRAMFS=1
2. From a terminal run:
  update-initramfs -u -t -k `uname -r`


There is a known issue when running from initramfs that directfb 0.9.25 and 1.1.x will go into an endless loop trying to read the keyboard event buffer after udev initializes a new /dev/tty* device. The solution to this problem is to tell directfb to sleep for a bit when reading the buffer. Please refer to:

http://splashy.alioth.debian.org/wiki/faq#when_running_from_initramfs_splashy_takes_100_of_the_cpu_and_boot_process_stops_using_init_only._not_upstart

Themes
======

To install a new theme, download it and install it with splashy_config:

  splashy_config -i <theme>

To use some theme as the default theme, run:

  splashy_config -s <theme_name>

You can get a list of available themes with:

  splashy_config --info

To create a theme, run "splashy_config -c" and answer all the questions

Themes are now located on /usr/share/splashy/themes. If /usr is mounted from a different partition/drive, you might want to put Splashy on initramfs or remove the symlink /etc/splashy/themes and copy the /usr/share/splashy/themes directory in this place. We felt that having so much data on /etc is a burden for sysadmins and other people who backup their system directories regularly.

Please note that if you run Splashy from initramfs, you need to update your initrd file after changing Splashy themes in /etc/splashy/config.xml. On Debian based distros this is done by running:

update-initramfs -u

Uninstallation
==============

See INSTALL document

You might need to remove vga= and splash from your kernel parameters.
