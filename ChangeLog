	* scripts/init.d/splashy: applies patch from Tim Richardson

2008-12-23  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* src/splashy_video.c: when using fonts, try the full path it looks like we were never using the font supply by the theme. this
	fixes this problem by building a path to the full file

2008-12-04  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* src/splashy_functions.c: when splashy test runs we can't exit too
	quickly this is a work around to a signal 11 crash that we get when we press
	ESC when the bar is 100%. exiting splashy goes into a race condition
	against re-drawing the background/progressbar. this is simply a
	workaround to this problem. a better solution should be more robust

2008-12-04  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* scripts/initramfs-tools/hooks/libsplashy.in: fixes paths inside
	initrd symlinks are not allowed in cpio, go figure; and since we don't need
	them, we skip this part

2008-12-04  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* src/xml_format.h.in: themes directory is now under
	/usr/share/splashy/themes this makes sure that splashy_config generates the right XML files

2008-11-16  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* NEWS: adds note about fall back theme

2008-11-16  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* scripts/initramfs-tools/hooks/libsplashy.in: copy the "default"
	theme also when users switch to a new theme, the "default" theme should be copy
	also as this is the fall-back theme for Splashy

2008-11-14  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* ChangeLog: ditto

2008-11-14  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* scripts/lsb-base-logging.sh: fixes bug with mysqld when upgrading
	mysql-server-5.0 This is the error: * Stopping MySQL database server mysqld
	 [ OK ] /etc/lsb-base-logging.sh: line 339: SPL_PRG: unbound variable  invoke-rc.d: initscript mysql, action "stop" failed.   invoke-rc.d returned 1  There is a MySQL server running, but we failed in our attempts to
	 stop it.  Stop it yourself and try again! Ouch!

2008-11-09  Fathi Boudra <fabo@debian.org>

	* ChangeLog, doc/config.xml.in: Update themes path. Themes were
	moved in /usr/share/splashy/themes since Splashy 0.3.6 release.

2008-10-29  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* NEWS, configure.ac: ready for 0.3.13

	* ChangeLog, NEWS: now we are ready for 0.3.12

2008-10-29  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* scripts/initramfs-tools/scripts/local-premount/libsplashy: test
	char devices before we create /dev/fb0 or any other char device under /dev, we
	check to see whether they already exist

2008-10-28  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* scripts/lsb-base-logging.sh: fixes issues with /etc/init.d/kdm this is a very ugly work around to the fact that /etc/init.d/kdm
	does not use LSB functions to start up.

2008-10-28  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* src/splashy_config-main.c: fixes DBTS 501997 needs to include locale.h when building without optimization

2008-10-18  Tim Dijkstra <tim@knolraap.drs.p>

	* scripts/Makefile.am,
	scripts/initramfs-tools/scripts/init-top/splashy,
	scripts/initramfs-tools/scripts/local-premount/libsplashy,
	scripts/initramfs-tools/scripts/local-premount/splashy: Make splashy
	start later during boot to give uswsusp the opportunity to start
	resume (and with it libsplashy).

2008-09-12  Fathi BOUDRA <fabo@debian.org>

	* po/fr.po: Update french translation.

2008-07-28  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* scripts/initramfs-tools/scripts/init-top/splashy: reverts $resume
	hack as a few people point out, having this does not really fix the
	problem of uswsusp+splashy conflict. this just makes splashy start
	late from the boot process as initramfs never actually starts
	splashy. Thanks Niko Cavallini Araya for helping iron this one out.

2008-07-28  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* scripts/initramfs-tools/scripts/init-top/splashy: chvt 8 only if
	Splashy is doing the work and not resuming by swsusp as suggested by Matthijs

2008-07-28  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* scripts/lsb-base-logging.sh: only run splashy-related functions
	when Splashy (package) is installed as suggested on the DBTS and mailinglist by Tim, if somebody
	uninstalls Splashy but does not purge the package, we do not want
	/etc/lsb-base-logging.sh to stop the boot process in anyway. This
	safely bails out from doing anything that's related to Splashy only.

2008-07-26  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* NEWS, configure.ac: Splashy 0.3.12 starts another iteration

2008-07-26  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

2008-07-26  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	for submitting this to us.

2008-07-25  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* po/index.html, po/splashy.pot: minor udpate

	* po/splashy.pot: new string added

2008-07-24  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* scripts/initramfs-tools/scripts/init-top/splashy: when resume is
	set we bail out reverts the wrong logic

2008-07-23  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* scripts/Makefile.am: chroot at initramfs

2008-07-23  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	move textbox to other areas Matthijs reported and fixed this for us.

	new log entries

	* NEWS: gets ready for 0.3.11

2008-07-22  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* scripts/initramfs-tools/scripts/init-top/splashy: if resume is
	set, we do not start Splashy suspend software like uswsusp knows how to start Splashy and it
	creates a conflict. Thanks Eric Doviak for reporting this, and
	suggest a solution, on Bug#486400

2008-07-09  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* src/splashy_config-functions.c: adds suggestion to run
	update-initramfs -u - code beautified - adds a new string to inform users that updating initrd is needed
	whenever Splashy runs from initramsf that is. We still need to
	figure out if this is set to true from /etc/default/splashy, and the
	correct command string to use on a per-distro basis.

2008-07-09  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* README: new note about update-initramfs -u. even though this is
	debian specific

2008-06-13  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* scripts/lsb-base-logging.sh: fixes artifacts under Xorg/Xserver For some people when Splashy stops and X starts, some strange black
	artifacts are shown on the screen. This is a quick fix to avoid this
	problem. Thanks Anton Fiuman for suggesting this fix.

2008-06-13  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* TODO: updates TODO

2008-06-13  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* scripts/lsb-base-logging.sh: closes Bug#486139 if log_daemon_message has a second argument that's empty, it breaks
	our printing of the log message. This patch by Alban Browaeys checks
	whether this parameter is empty before checking for "?dm"

2008-05-28  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* scripts/init.d/splashy, scripts/lsb-base-logging.sh: attempts to
	be more efficient at shutdown there is no need to call pidof splashy more than once also, we need
	to return a digit from log_* functions

2008-05-27  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* HACKING: removes allowchvt as this is not needed

2008-05-27  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* NEWS, README: updates documentation

2008-05-27  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* scripts/lsb-base-logging.sh: during shutdown do not set progress
	to 100% to early if KDM, XDM or GDM scripts are called, we don't want the progress to
	grow to 100% before the system is done shuttingdown/rebooting.

2008-05-27  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* scripts/init.d/splashy: minor cleanups very aesthethic changes...

2008-05-27  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* scripts/init.d/splashy: using new interface to omit PIDs from
	being kill by killall Thanks Petter Reinholdtsen for submitting this to us. DBTS#482017

2008-05-27  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* ChangeLog: ditto

2008-05-27  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* scripts/lsb-base-logging.sh: fixes kilall think0 Thanks lexiw (from ArchLinux. on Splashy IRC channel) for reporting
	this.

2008-05-13  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* scripts/init.d/splashy: attempts to hide the text when switching
	from X11 tty to Splashy when gdm stops and Splashy is about to start, sometimes there is
	ugly text displayed on the screen. This attempts to clear the tty
	and changing to it before proceeding.

2008-05-12  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* scripts/lsb-base-logging.sh: stop progress when shutting down if we are shutting down, we don't want to set progress to 100% too
	early (like if we find X running). This could make the ugly effect
	of having the progress bar "jump" from 100 and back to the prev
	number (at this point the bar moves backwards). It looks odd

2008-05-12  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* scripts/lsb-base-logging.sh: changed default from 7 to 1 1 is a more sane default for TTYs. users running X should set this
	to their prefer methods if they ever see some text in the console...
	sorry about this but there is no middle ground for non-X users and
	those who do

2008-05-12  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* scripts/default/splashy: defaults to auto tty let lsb-base-logging.sh detect if X is running and automatically
	switch to that TTY. if no X, then we go to tty 1 by default

2008-05-12  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* src/splashy_functions.c: tests for directory existance do not chroot if dir do not exist

2008-05-12  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* scripts/init.d/splashy: sleep for a bit to allow Splashy to start if we don't sleep we get a message "Splashy ERROR: Connection
	refused"

2008-05-10  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* scripts/lsb-base-logging.sh: new LSB functions added. This needs
	more testing

2008-04-23  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* NEWS: getting ready to release

2008-04-23  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* scripts/lsb-base-logging.sh: Fixes Bug # 470816 If running a a initrc script from cron and RUNLEVEL can't be
	defined, we simply exit. Hopefully this will fix a plethora of weird
	problems (and perhaps not introduce anything too serious)

2008-04-23  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* src/splashy_functions.c: Fixes getstring/getpass locks (Bug
	#473101) Thanks to John Hughes for submitting this patch to us.

2008-04-23  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* scripts/initramfs-tools/hooks/splashy: Bug #473109 Splashy + LUKS need to cooperate. This allows splashy_update to be
	included in initramfs so other systems can call for ways to update
	the password during boot

2008-04-23  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* scripts/default/splashy: Bug# 459729 There is no good number as default for tty's. Assuming that Splashy
	will run on desktops, we are changing the default to tty7.

2008-04-16  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* src/splashy_functions.c: fixed comment

	their configure.{ac,in} files:  PKG_CHECK_MODULES([SPLASHY],
	splashy).  Thanks Holger Macht <hmacht@suse.de> for submitting this
	patch

2008-01-26  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* src/splashy.h, src/splashy_video.c: removes need for glib.h on
	libsplashy's splashy.h. Thanks Holger Macht from SuSE

	scripts/initramfs-tools/scripts/init-top/splashy: Thanks Luca
	Capello <luca@pca.it> Applied patch as reported on Bug #459457 reported by Luca.  This
	patch checks whether all system functionality are in place before
	starting Splashy at all.

2008-01-08  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* scripts/lsb-base-logging.sh: minor fix while pidof splashy > /dev/null instead of the output of that
	command

2008-01-08  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* scripts/console-tools/config.d/splashy,
	scripts/lsb-base-logging.sh: do not use /dev/shm anymore to hold
	temp files now we use our own STEPS_DIR

2008-01-08  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* scripts/lsb-base-logging.sh: cleanup after console-screen and
	keymap.sh have finished we need to do this before we switch tty's so the end-user does not
	see any text

2008-01-08  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* scripts/lsb-base-logging.sh: clears tty8 after Splashy exits we don't want to see any text no the screen while Splashy is running
	(or after)

2007-12-30  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* scripts/lsb-base-logging.sh: reports no errors if grep fails to find our mount, we still report no errors. this
	should fix problems with /etc/init.d/xdm and others that are set to
	'set -e'

2007-12-26  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

2007-12-23  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* scripts/lsb-base-logging.sh: due to bug#455685 we are adding || return 0 to the LSB function that's called from
	gdm/kdm and the like. This will prevent gdm to break even if
	stop_splashy() does not work correctly. Thanks Steve Fosdick (and
	others who suggested the same) for suggesting this.

2007-12-21  Luis Mondesi <luigi@tuxy.i.kiskeyix.org>

	* scripts/initramfs-tools/hooks/splashy,
	scripts/initramfs-tools/scripts/init-top/splashy: copies
	splashy_chvt to initramfs we use vt8 by default

2007-12-21  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* scripts/initramfs-tools/scripts/init-top/splashy: no need to call
	grep /proc/fb this assumes user use vesafb. splashy will show the right error

2007-12-21  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* src/splashy_video.c: back to catching input - enabling linux_input causes system to loose keyboard events - no-vt option causes -9 errors because create_event_buffer() fails - we need graphic-vts unless we go to vt 8 where no text is printed - we tell directfb to switch to vt 8 regardless, this should avoid   issues from initramfs

2007-12-21  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* src/splashy_video.c: oops

2007-12-21  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* src/splashy_video.c: strings not international yet we should enable them at a later time

2007-12-21  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* configure.ac: new version

2007-12-21  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* src/splashy_video.c: module madness - disables vt* (and makes sure that vt number 8 is preferred just in
	case) and disables graphics-vt - points to FAQ using tinyurl http://tinyurl.com/339h67. This should
	help people fix Splashy when they don't follow the README
	instructions

	* ChangeLog: ditto to say

2007-12-15  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* scripts/console-tools/config.d/splashy,

	we stopped it before this only mean something on Debian systems. and now it means less
	for any other distro.

	* splashy.spec: ready for new release

2007-12-09  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* splashy.spec: fixes a number of bugs Splashy should be installed in /lib,/sbin and not /usr/* The reason
	is because /usr is mounted late for some people (unless users are
	planning to use Splashy from initramfs, which is not the case for
	Fedora/Redhat yet)

2007-11-28  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* scripts/lsb-base-logging.sh: improvements to minimize bug 451846 this makes sure that we only call splashy_update in the event that
	splashy is actually running in stop_splashy. in other words, set the
	progress to 100% and exit

2007-11-28  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* src/splashy_video.c: avoids oddities in bits per pixel settings this is more precise

2007-11-22  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* src/splashy_video.c: attempts to set the resolution with
	SetVideoMode this only works for drivers other than vesafb. Also, note that
	directfb uses /sys/class/graphics/fb0/* to set the (virtual) size
	for the screen. this might or might not match the size of the actual
	resolution. we are working on a work around

2007-11-22  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* src/splashy_video.c: shows resolution of primary surface for
	debugging purposes

2007-11-22  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* NEWS: note about screen size this should seal this problem

2007-11-22  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* src/splashy_video.c: do not trust the resolution as reported by
	primary_{window,}_surface->GetSize() the resolution reported by the ->GetSize() call for the *surface
	tends to be according to whatever size is reported by directfb from
	adding (double+) the size of the actual screen size. This means that
	on dual-head video cards, the height is twice as much as it should
	be (from what ioctl() reports from /dev/fb0). Since Splashy is only
	concern on the size of the screen visible by the user, and not the
	view that it's possible to go to, we introduced a _get_screen_size()
	helper that should eliminate this problem

2007-11-22  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* src/splashy_video.c: calls getsize from window surface primary_surface and primary_window_surface should be the same
	anyway, but we really mean primary_window_surface on these

2007-11-22  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* src/splashy_video.c: shows more debug info shows dimension values

2007-11-22  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* src/xml_parser.c: base value cannot be 1 the values are 1 < N < 36 or 0. So, N is never 1 but it can be the
	special value 0. See: man 3 strtol.

2007-11-21  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* src/splashy_video.c: divider info reports actual divider size. this helps us troubleshooting
	resolution problems

2007-11-21  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* src/splashy_video.c: shows what the actual dimension for the
	created window is just in case something goes wrong and we are using different values

2007-11-21  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* src/splashy_video.c: code cleanups. xres/yres implies resolution ok, this makes a distinction between the surface/screen/window all
	treated as the same thing. width and height really means the size of
	one of those 3 (in fullscreen mode, it makes no difference). We now
	use xres and yres to refer to the resolution of the actual screen as
	reported by /dev/fb* (loaded framebuffer). minor and subtle way of
	thinking about it

2007-11-21  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* src/splashy_video.c: uses values from /dev/fb0 or whatever
	FRAMEBUFFER device reported from the environment This avoids problems where the resolution and viewport values happen
	to be mismatched

2007-11-19  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* src/splashy_video.c: adds TODO we need to make the _get_string() colors theme-able

2007-11-19  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* scripts/default/splashy: by default stay in your tty do not go to 6 or any tty number. let the system decide

2007-11-19  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* src/Makefile.am: libgcc is needed adds back libgcc_s. we need this to use pthread* correctly

2007-11-16  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* po/es.po, po/index.html, po/splashy.pot: Spanish translation done 2nd translation ready

2007-11-16  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* po/sk.po: needed to add fuzzy back to validate ./check_po.pl complaints about msgid being empty... go figure

2007-11-16  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* po/sk.po: Slovak translation Here is the first translation from a non-splashy developer. Thanks a
	bunch Ivan Masár < helix84 NOSPAMAT centrum ! sk > for taking time
	to send us this.

2007-11-16  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* po/splashy.pot, po/stats.pl: more modernizations minor touches

2007-11-15  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* po/index.html: beautify the status page This allows translators to know what's missing and to quickly pickup
	where other translators left of:
	http://splashy.alioth.debian.org/i18n/

2007-11-15  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* configure.ac: only one language now...  we will add more later

2007-11-15  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* autogen.sh: use glib-gettextize goes to show that there are always ways to abuse sh scripts...
	(hint: read gettextize and look for tty)

2007-11-15  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* po/es.po: Spanish translation a few strings translated to Spanish. Just to get the ball rolling...

2007-11-15  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* ChangeLog: latest and greatest

2007-11-15  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* Makefile.am, configure.ac: gettextize'd Gettextize added the right things. Adds detection for --enable-debug
	so we enable assertions in glib when in debug-mode. Other minor
	additions...

2007-11-15  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* src/splashy_config-functions.c: corrected grammar Ah, English can be so sweet sometimes...

2007-11-14  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* scripts/lsb-base-logging.sh: calling stop_splashy means 100%
	progress automatically this is just for consistency...

2007-11-13  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* src/splashy.h: private function needs prototype early for
	splashy_video.c we need to expose this function to be able to toggle F2

2007-11-13  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* src/splashy_video.c: _clear_offscreen takes no argument this makes it clear. This is a private function. no need to call it
	from outside of libsplashy::splashy_* public interface

2007-11-13  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* src/splashy_video.c: when F2 is pressed show something do the right thing when the visibility of the textbox is toggle on
	or off

2007-11-12  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* NEWS, src/splashy.h, src/splashy_functions.c, src/splashy_video.c: 
	implements verbose from LSB script uses "splashy_update scroll ..." to send the message being printed
	during each initrc script completion. If the user presses F2, he/she
	will be presented with an overlay box showing the scrolling text.
	Also code cleanups.

2007-11-12  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* scripts/lsb-base-logging.sh: sends initrc messages to splashy if splashy is running, send the initrc boot message so users can see
	it if they press F2

2007-11-11  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* configure.ac: disable static

2007-11-11  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* src/Makefile.am: comments

2007-11-11  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* configure.ac: note on non-static

2007-11-11  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* scripts/init.d/splashy: tell killall5 to give us a longer break splashy will exit by itself when it times out

2007-11-10  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* configure.ac: static not needed no need to define these macros

2007-11-08  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* NEWS, README, configure.ac, src/Makefile.am: drop static build by
	default we are not using static builds any more. if you need to do this for
	one reason or another, please see README, src/Makefile.am and
	configure.ac. It's pretty straight forward to re-enable it.

2007-10-29  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* scripts/contrib/git2cl: adds new functionality now it allows you to use this command as a filter if called like:
	git log ... | git2cl Got in contact with upstream developer and
	these changes will be included upstream as well.

2007-10-29  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* src/Makefile.am: makes splashy_update static even though splashy_update is really use after the system is already
	running, sometimes we need to use this command very early or over
	the network (LTSP) and it needs to have all its libraries included
	in itself. For now, we are shipping this static as well as Splashy
	binary itself. Later we will drop all static

2007-10-28  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* ChangeLog: new changes

2007-10-28  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* scripts/contrib/git2cl: passed thru perltidy -gnu

2007-10-28  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* scripts/contrib/git2cl: script to convert git log to GNU ChangeLog This script is a copy from http://josefsson.org/git2cl/. It includes
	bug fixes by me and it drops dependancy on non-standard module
	Date::Parse

2007-10-28  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* ChangeLog: Real GNU ChangeLog format. Refer to git2cl inside
	scripts/contrib

2007-10-26  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* HACKING, NEWS, src/splashy_functions.c, src/splashy_video.c: text
	scrolling complete Now we are able to have messages scroll during boot: splashy_update
	"scroll TEXT TO DISPLAY" splashy_update "scroll TEXT CONTINUES ON
	NEW LINE" ...  We need an option in /etc/splashy/config.xml to
	enable/disable this feature. lsb-* initrc functions should check for
	this option when using splashy_update to display text during boot.

2007-10-21  Tim Dijkstra <tdykstra@commensaal.drs.p>

	* HACKING: Added some comments about the undocumented `getstring'
	and `getpass' commands of splashy_update. Also removed the paragraph
	about writing to a fifo, that is no longer true.

2007-10-21  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* src/splashy_functions.c: cmd_print_scroll uses splashy print scroll function

2007-10-21  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* HACKING: new command print_scroll makes it easier to implement VERBOSE from initrc scripts

2007-10-21  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* README: note on patch this patch was applied upstream

2007-10-20  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* ChangeLog: perhaps time for a new API (code cleanups)

2007-10-20  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* src/splashy_functions.c: deprecated function this assumes a Linux system and it's simply not used any more. Exit
	-2 means that the framebuffer wasn't init'd by the kernel. On BSD*
	and other *NIX this might be done differently...

2007-10-18  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* HACKING, NEWS, configure.ac: Splashy 0.3.7 begins The cycle starts here

2007-10-18  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* ChangeLog: new release 0.3.6 Splashy 0.3.6 is here

2007-10-18  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* HACKING: make -j8 breaks build notes about -lsplashycnf link errors (ld) when using parallel builds
	(multiple make instances)

2007-10-16  Tim Dijkstra <tdykstra@commensaal.drs.p>

	* configure.ac, src/Makefile.am: Add d-c --libs to splashy_LDADD,
	this fixes the issue of building a properly linked dynamic and
	static version of libsplashy

2007-10-15  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* src/Makefile.am: order of library link was wrong -lsplashycnf must not be the first to link for splashy_config. This
	makes it "last" in the list

2007-10-15  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* HACKING: signed tags are needed

2007-10-15  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* ChangeLog: notes

2007-10-15  Luis Mondesi <lmondesi@zod.(none)>

	* ChangeLog: new notes

2007-10-15  Luis Mondesi <lmondesi@zod.(none)>

	* README: no more svn notes about sources from Git repo

2007-10-15  Luis Mondesi <lmondesi@zod.(none)>

	* HACKING: updated the release procedure we are using git now, which makes things a bit easier (and with less
	storage need)

2007-10-15  Luis Mondesi <lmondesi@zod.(none)>

	* ChangeLog: new release

2007-10-15  Luis Mondesi <lmondesi@zod.(none)>

	* NEWS, README: adds notes about moving themes to
	/usr/share/splashy/themes Ready to release

2007-10-03  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* ChangeLog: minor stuff added

2007-10-03  Tim Dijkstra <tdykstra@commensaal.drs.p>

	* configure.ac: Make configure.ac use pkg-config to pick up the
	correct path to the modules.

2007-10-03  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* scripts/lsb-base-logging.sh: do not complaint if tmpfs not mounted if user exits gdm, do not complaint about umounting the tmpfs we
	created and umounted during boot

2007-10-03  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* scripts/lsb-base-logging.sh: attempts to make Splashy exit faster do not check for things that are not necessary. just get out quickly

2007-10-03  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* scripts/default/splashy: use tty6 by default after Splashy exits tty6 should not have any weird messages and it will also work fine
	if gdm/kdm/xdm fails to start X

2007-10-03  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* scripts/default/splashy: switch to tty8 by default since this is a desktop, we default to a tty that has no text on it
	after Splashy is done. It should allow gdm/kdm/xdm to start and
	switch to tty7

2007-10-03  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* Makefile.am: create a symlink in /etc/splashy/themes ->
	/usr/share/splashy/themes this allows Splashy to work normally during shutdown (i.e. not
	running from initramfs)

2007-10-03  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* ChangeLog: getting ready to release

2007-10-03  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* scripts/default/splashy: run from initramfs by default now that we know what the problem with directfb was, we can set this
	to a sane default

2007-10-03  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* README: note on fixing keyboard event issue this should allow anybody to use init and directfb to start splashy
	from initramfs

2007-10-03  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* src/splashy_functions.c: disable console reading text the thread that reads messages from the console is buggy and not
	used. this code actually slows down Splashy and causes SEGV and ABRT
	signals to be caught when exiting with ESC while in Splashy "test"
	mode. We need to revisit this feature later. splashy_update "text
	foo" should still work and allow users to send messages to the text
	overlay. F2 also works

2007-10-03  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* src/splashy_video.c: print debugging info when releasing get more information about what's being released when running in
	debug mode

2007-10-03  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* scripts/lsb-base-logging.sh: gets rid of tmpfs when done when done with Splashy, get rid of tmpfs if not in debug mode

2007-10-02  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* src/Makefile.am: adding -ldirectfb breaks the build process there does not seem to be a need to add -ldirectfb on Directfb 1.0.1
	from experimental

2007-10-01  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* NEWS: directfb 1.x supported Now we can say that we officially support dfb 1.x. Older version of
	the library still work fine (0.9.25 in particular)

2007-10-01  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* src/libglib-2.0.la: this file does not belong in Splashy ditto

2007-09-30  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* src/Makefile.am: cleanups removes old comments and added new (cleaner) ones

2007-09-30  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* src/Makefile.am: adds -static-libgcc option to gcc this avoids having a binary that cannot find pthread cancel calls
	from libgcc_s

2007-09-30  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* scripts/init.d/splashy: adds debug string add ways to know if splashy has been launched multiple times

2007-09-29  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* scripts/lsb-base-logging.sh: uptime is not available at times this makes sure that we always get the loadavergage readings during
