	* HACKING, NEWS, src/splashy_functions.c, src/splashy_video.c: text
	scrolling complete Now we are able to have messages scroll during boot: splashy_update
	"scroll TEXT TO DISPLAY" splashy_update "scroll TEXT CONTINUES ON
	NEW LINE" ...  We need an option in /etc/splashy/config.xml to
	enable/disable this feature. lsb-* initrc functions should check for
	this option when using splashy_update to display text during boot.

2007-10-21  Tim Dijkstra <tdykstra@commensaal.drs.p>

	* HACKING: Added some comments about the undocumented `getstring'
	and `getpass' commands of splashy_update. Also removed the paragraph
	about writing to a fifo, that is no longer true.

2007-10-21  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* src/splashy_functions.c: cmd_print_scroll uses splashy print scroll function

2007-10-21  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* HACKING: new command print_scroll makes it easier to implement VERBOSE from initrc scripts

2007-10-21  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* README: note on patch this patch was applied upstream

2007-10-20  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* ChangeLog: perhaps time for a new API (code cleanups)

2007-10-20  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* src/splashy_functions.c: deprecated function this assumes a Linux system and it's simply not used any more. Exit
	-2 means that the framebuffer wasn't init'd by the kernel. On BSD*
	and other *NIX this might be done differently...

2007-10-18  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* HACKING, NEWS, configure.ac: Splashy 0.3.7 begins The cycle starts here

2007-10-18  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* ChangeLog: new release 0.3.6 Splashy 0.3.6 is here

2007-10-18  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* HACKING: make -j8 breaks build notes about -lsplashycnf link errors (ld) when using parallel builds
	(multiple make instances)

2007-10-16  Tim Dijkstra <tdykstra@commensaal.drs.p>

	* configure.ac, src/Makefile.am: Add d-c --libs to splashy_LDADD,
	this fixes the issue of building a properly linked dynamic and
	static version of libsplashy

2007-10-15  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* src/Makefile.am: order of library link was wrong -lsplashycnf must not be the first to link for splashy_config. This
	makes it "last" in the list

2007-10-15  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* HACKING: signed tags are needed

2007-10-15  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* ChangeLog: notes

2007-10-15  Luis Mondesi <lmondesi@zod.(none)>

	* ChangeLog: new notes

2007-10-15  Luis Mondesi <lmondesi@zod.(none)>

	* README: no more svn notes about sources from Git repo

2007-10-15  Luis Mondesi <lmondesi@zod.(none)>

	* HACKING: updated the release procedure we are using git now, which makes things a bit easier (and with less
	storage need)

2007-10-15  Luis Mondesi <lmondesi@zod.(none)>

	* ChangeLog: new release

2007-10-15  Luis Mondesi <lmondesi@zod.(none)>

	* NEWS, README: adds notes about moving themes to
	/usr/share/splashy/themes Ready to release

2007-10-03  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* ChangeLog: minor stuff added

2007-10-03  Tim Dijkstra <tdykstra@commensaal.drs.p>

	* configure.ac: Make configure.ac use pkg-config to pick up the
	correct path to the modules.

2007-10-03  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* scripts/lsb-base-logging.sh: do not complaint if tmpfs not mounted if user exits gdm, do not complaint about umounting the tmpfs we
	created and umounted during boot

2007-10-03  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* scripts/lsb-base-logging.sh: attempts to make Splashy exit faster do not check for things that are not necessary. just get out quickly

2007-10-03  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* scripts/default/splashy: use tty6 by default after Splashy exits tty6 should not have any weird messages and it will also work fine
	if gdm/kdm/xdm fails to start X

2007-10-03  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* scripts/default/splashy: switch to tty8 by default since this is a desktop, we default to a tty that has no text on it
	after Splashy is done. It should allow gdm/kdm/xdm to start and
	switch to tty7

2007-10-03  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* Makefile.am: create a symlink in /etc/splashy/themes ->
	/usr/share/splashy/themes this allows Splashy to work normally during shutdown (i.e. not
	running from initramfs)

2007-10-03  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* ChangeLog: getting ready to release

2007-10-03  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* scripts/default/splashy: run from initramfs by default now that we know what the problem with directfb was, we can set this
	to a sane default

2007-10-03  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* README: note on fixing keyboard event issue this should allow anybody to use init and directfb to start splashy
	from initramfs

2007-10-03  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* src/splashy_functions.c: disable console reading text the thread that reads messages from the console is buggy and not
	used. this code actually slows down Splashy and causes SEGV and ABRT
	signals to be caught when exiting with ESC while in Splashy "test"
	mode. We need to revisit this feature later. splashy_update "text
	foo" should still work and allow users to send messages to the text
	overlay. F2 also works

2007-10-03  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* src/splashy_video.c: print debugging info when releasing get more information about what's being released when running in
	debug mode

2007-10-03  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* scripts/lsb-base-logging.sh: gets rid of tmpfs when done when done with Splashy, get rid of tmpfs if not in debug mode

2007-10-02  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* src/Makefile.am: adding -ldirectfb breaks the build process there does not seem to be a need to add -ldirectfb on Directfb 1.0.1
	from experimental

2007-10-01  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* NEWS: directfb 1.x supported Now we can say that we officially support dfb 1.x. Older version of
	the library still work fine (0.9.25 in particular)

2007-10-01  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* src/libglib-2.0.la: this file does not belong in Splashy ditto

2007-09-30  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* src/Makefile.am: cleanups removes old comments and added new (cleaner) ones

2007-09-30  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* src/Makefile.am: adds -static-libgcc option to gcc this avoids having a binary that cannot find pthread cancel calls
	from libgcc_s

2007-09-30  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* scripts/init.d/splashy: adds debug string add ways to know if splashy has been launched multiple times

2007-09-29  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* scripts/lsb-base-logging.sh: uptime is not available at times this makes sure that we always get the loadavergage readings during
	boot (in DEBUG mode)

2007-09-29  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* scripts/default/splashy: we need to switch to tty1 using "auto" is not a good default now. when gdm is not installed,
	we need to go back to tty1

2007-09-29  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* src/Makefile.am: put back the static compilation splashy works fine without being -static, however, if we are going
	to enable initramfs by default, then it's better to just keep the
	things in initrd to a minimun

2007-09-29  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* ChangeLog: new log new changes

2007-09-29  root <root@localhost.localdomain>

	* NEWS: rpm packages supported now we are able to support RPM packages

2007-09-29  root <root@localhost.localdomain>

	* src/Makefile.am: on Fedora we do not like -all-static helps the creation of Splashy packages for RPM-based systems. the
	directfb-devel package does not include the required .a files (or .o
	for that matter)

2007-09-29  root <root@localhost.localdomain>

	* splashy.spec: compiles on Fedora Core 7 RPM package is now built correctly. A macro in ~/.rpmmacros was
	needed to avoid  stupid warning: %debug_package %{nil}

2007-09-29  root <root@localhost.localdomain>

	* src/splashy_main.c: on Fedora gcc throws warn freopen() returns a FILE*. catch this

2007-09-28  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* HACKING: Theme specifications included This should give an idea to non-programmers what is needed to build
	a theme for Splashy

2007-09-28  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* splashy.spec: dependencies added libpng-static and file-devel are also needed

2007-09-28  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>
