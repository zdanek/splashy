    attempts to make Splashy exit faster
    
    do not check for things that are not necessary. just get out quickly

Author: Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>
Date:   Wed Oct 3 11:34:35 2007 -0400

    use tty6 by default after Splashy exits
    
    tty6 should not have any weird messages and it will also work fine if gdm/kdm/xdm fails to start X

Author: Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>
Date:   Wed Oct 3 09:57:22 2007 -0400

    switch to tty8 by default
    
    since this is a desktop, we default to a tty that has no text on it after Splashy is done. It should allow gdm/kdm/xdm to start and switch to tty7

    create a symlink in /etc/splashy/themes -> /usr/share/splashy/themes
    
    this allows Splashy to work normally during shutdown (i.e. not running from initramfs)

    run from initramfs by default
    
    now that we know what the problem with directfb was, we can set this to a sane default

Author: Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>
Date:   Wed Oct 3 08:36:26 2007 -0400

    note on fixing keyboard event issue
    
    this should allow anybody to use init and directfb to start splashy from initramfs

commit 3091ccc1c60053ea5e72eae0ca307b99158fa50d
Author: Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>
Date:   Wed Oct 3 08:11:32 2007 -0400

    disable console reading text
    
    the thread that reads messages from the console is buggy and not used. this code actually slows down Splashy and causes SEGV and ABRT signals to be caught when exiting with ESC while in Splashy "test" mode. We need to revisit this feature later. splashy_update "text foo" should still work and allow users to send messages to the text overlay. F2 also works

    adding -ldirectfb breaks the build process
    
    there does not seem to be a need to add -ldirectfb on Directfb 1.0.1 from experimental

Author: Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>
Date:   Mon Oct 1 12:33:47 2007 -0400

    directfb 1.x supported

    we need to switch to tty1
    
    using "auto" is not a good default now. when gdm is not installed, we need to go back to tty1

    put back the static compilation
    
    splashy works fine without being -static, however, if we are going to enable initramfs by default, then it's better to just keep the things in initrd to a minimun
