2007-12-23  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* scripts/lsb-base-logging.sh: due to bug#455685 we are adding || return 0 to the LSB function that's called from
	gdm/kdm and the like. This will prevent gdm to break even if
	stop_splashy() does not work correctly. Thanks Steve Fosdick (and
	others who suggested the same) for suggesting this.

2007-12-21  Luis Mondesi <luigi@tuxy.i.kiskeyix.org>

	* scripts/initramfs-tools/hooks/splashy,
	scripts/initramfs-tools/scripts/init-top/splashy: copies
	splashy_chvt to initramfs we use vt8 by default

2007-12-21  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* scripts/initramfs-tools/scripts/init-top/splashy: no need to call
	grep /proc/fb this assumes user use vesafb. splashy will show the right error

2007-12-21  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* src/splashy_video.c: back to catching input - enabling linux_input causes system to loose keyboard events - no-vt option causes -9 errors because create_event_buffer() fails - we need graphic-vts unless we go to vt 8 where no text is printed - we tell directfb to switch to vt 8 regardless, this should avoid   issues from initramfs

2007-12-21  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* src/splashy_video.c: oops

2007-12-21  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* src/splashy_video.c: strings not international yet we should enable them at a later time

2007-12-21  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* HACKING: update wiki version information and link in the wiki needs to be updated

2007-12-21  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* configure.ac: new version

2007-12-21  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* src/splashy_video.c: module madness - disables vt* (and makes sure that vt number 8 is preferred just in
	case) and disables graphics-vt - points to FAQ using tinyurl http://tinyurl.com/339h67. This should
	help people fix Splashy when they don't follow the README
	instructions

2007-12-20  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* NEWS, configure.ac: hungarian translation added

	* ChangeLog: a new release should follow shortly.

2007-12-17  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* scripts/lsb-base-logging.sh: closes bug #455259 Bug 455259 talks about Splashy trying to umount something that does
	not exist the second time some initrc script calls log_daemon_msg().
	This fixes that.

2007-12-15  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* ChangeLog: ditto to say

2007-12-15  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* scripts/console-tools/config.d/splashy,
	scripts/lsb-base-logging.sh: only run keymap.sh/console-screen.sh if
	we stopped it before this only mean something on Debian systems. and now it means less
	for any other distro.

2007-12-12  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	framebuffer setup

	* splashy.spec: ready for new release

2007-12-09  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* splashy.spec: fixes a number of bugs Splashy should be installed in /lib,/sbin and not /usr/* The reason
	is because /usr is mounted late for some people (unless users are
	planning to use Splashy from initramfs, which is not the case for
	Fedora/Redhat yet)

2007-12-08  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

2007-11-28  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* scripts/lsb-base-logging.sh: improvements to minimize bug 451846 this makes sure that we only call splashy_update in the event that
	splashy is actually running in stop_splashy. in other words, set the
	progress to 100% and exit

2007-11-28  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

2007-11-22  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* src/splashy_video.c: avoids oddities in bits per pixel settings this is more precise

2007-11-22  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* src/splashy_video.c: attempts to set the resolution with
	SetVideoMode this only works for drivers other than vesafb. Also, note that
	directfb uses /sys/class/graphics/fb0/* to set the (virtual) size
	for the screen. this might or might not match the size of the actual
	resolution. we are working on a work around

2007-11-22  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* src/splashy_video.c: shows resolution of primary surface for
	debugging purposes

2007-11-22  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* NEWS: note about screen size this should seal this problem

2007-11-22  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* src/splashy_video.c: do not trust the resolution as reported by
	primary_{window,}_surface->GetSize() the resolution reported by the ->GetSize() call for the *surface
	tends to be according to whatever size is reported by directfb from
	adding (double+) the size of the actual screen size. This means that
	on dual-head video cards, the height is twice as much as it should
	be (from what ioctl() reports from /dev/fb0). Since Splashy is only
	concern on the size of the screen visible by the user, and not the
	view that it's possible to go to, we introduced a _get_screen_size()
	helper that should eliminate this problem

2007-11-22  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* src/splashy_video.c: calls getsize from window surface primary_surface and primary_window_surface should be the same
	anyway, but we really mean primary_window_surface on these

2007-11-22  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* src/splashy_video.c: shows more debug info shows dimension values

2007-11-22  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* src/xml_parser.c: base value cannot be 1 the values are 1 < N < 36 or 0. So, N is never 1 but it can be the
	special value 0. See: man 3 strtol.

2007-11-21  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* src/splashy_video.c: divider info reports actual divider size. this helps us troubleshooting
	resolution problems

2007-11-21  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* src/splashy_video.c: shows what the actual dimension for the
	created window is just in case something goes wrong and we are using different values

2007-11-21  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* src/splashy_video.c: code cleanups. xres/yres implies resolution ok, this makes a distinction between the surface/screen/window all
	treated as the same thing. width and height really means the size of
	one of those 3 (in fullscreen mode, it makes no difference). We now
	use xres and yres to refer to the resolution of the actual screen as
	reported by /dev/fb* (loaded framebuffer). minor and subtle way of
	thinking about it

2007-11-21  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* src/splashy_video.c: uses values from /dev/fb0 or whatever
	FRAMEBUFFER device reported from the environment This avoids problems where the resolution and viewport values happen
	to be mismatched

2007-11-19  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* src/splashy_video.c: adds TODO we need to make the _get_string() colors theme-able

2007-11-19  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* scripts/default/splashy: by default stay in your tty do not go to 6 or any tty number. let the system decide

2007-11-19  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* src/Makefile.am: libgcc is needed adds back libgcc_s. we need this to use pthread* correctly

2007-11-16  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* po/es.po, po/index.html, po/splashy.pot: Spanish translation done 2nd translation ready

2007-11-16  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* po/sk.po: needed to add fuzzy back to validate ./check_po.pl complaints about msgid being empty... go figure

	bunch Ivan Masár < helix84 NOSPAMAT centrum ! sk > for taking time
	to send us this.

2007-11-16  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* po/index.html: beautify the status page This allows translators to know what's missing and to quickly pickup
	where other translators left of:
	http://splashy.alioth.debian.org/i18n/

2007-11-15  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* configure.ac: only one language now...  we will add more later

2007-11-15  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* autogen.sh: use glib-gettextize goes to show that there are always ways to abuse sh scripts...
	(hint: read gettextize and look for tty)

2007-11-15  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* po/es.po: Spanish translation a few strings translated to Spanish. Just to get the ball rolling...

2007-11-15  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

2007-11-15  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* Makefile.am, configure.ac: gettextize'd Gettextize added the right things. Adds detection for --enable-debug

	additions...

	* src/splashy_config-functions.c: corrected grammar Ah, English can be so sweet sometimes...

2007-11-14  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* scripts/lsb-base-logging.sh: calling stop_splashy means 100%
	progress automatically this is just for consistency...

2007-11-13  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* src/splashy.h: private function needs prototype early for
	splashy_video.c we need to expose this function to be able to toggle F2

2007-11-13  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* src/splashy_video.c: _clear_offscreen takes no argument this makes it clear. This is a private function. no need to call it
	from outside of libsplashy::splashy_* public interface

2007-11-13  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* src/splashy_video.c: when F2 is pressed show something do the right thing when the visibility of the textbox is toggle on
	or off

2007-11-12  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* NEWS, src/splashy.h, src/splashy_functions.c, src/splashy_video.c: 
	implements verbose from LSB script uses "splashy_update scroll ..." to send the message being printed
	during each initrc script completion. If the user presses F2, he/she
	will be presented with an overlay box showing the scrolling text.
	Also code cleanups.

2007-11-12  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* scripts/lsb-base-logging.sh: sends initrc messages to splashy if splashy is running, send the initrc boot message so users can see
	it if they press F2

2007-11-11  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* configure.ac: disable static

2007-11-11  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* src/Makefile.am: comments

2007-11-11  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* configure.ac: note on non-static

2007-11-10  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* configure.ac: static not needed no need to define these macros

2007-11-08  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* NEWS, README, configure.ac, src/Makefile.am: drop static build by
	default we are not using static builds any more. if you need to do this for
	one reason or another, please see README, src/Makefile.am and
	configure.ac. It's pretty straight forward to re-enable it.

2007-10-29  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* scripts/contrib/git2cl: adds new functionality now it allows you to use this command as a filter if called like:
	git log ... | git2cl Got in contact with upstream developer and
	these changes will be included upstream as well.

2007-10-29  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* src/Makefile.am: makes splashy_update static even though splashy_update is really use after the system is already
	running, sometimes we need to use this command very early or over
	the network (LTSP) and it needs to have all its libraries included
	in itself. For now, we are shipping this static as well as Splashy
	binary itself. Later we will drop all static

2007-10-28  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* ChangeLog: new changes

2007-10-28  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

2007-10-26  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* HACKING, NEWS, src/splashy_functions.c, src/splashy_video.c: text
	scrolling complete Now we are able to have messages scroll during boot: splashy_update
	"scroll TEXT TO DISPLAY" splashy_update "scroll TEXT CONTINUES ON
	NEW LINE" ...  We need an option in /etc/splashy/config.xml to
	enable/disable this feature. lsb-* initrc functions should check for
	this option when using splashy_update to display text during boot.

2007-10-21  Tim Dijkstra <tdykstra@commensaal.drs.p>

	* HACKING: Added some comments about the undocumented `getstring'
	and `getpass' commands of splashy_update. Also removed the paragraph
	about writing to a fifo, that is no longer true.

2007-10-21  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* src/splashy_functions.c: cmd_print_scroll uses splashy print scroll function

2007-10-21  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

2007-10-21  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* README: note on patch this patch was applied upstream

2007-10-20  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* ChangeLog: perhaps time for a new API (code cleanups)

2007-10-20  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* src/splashy_functions.c: deprecated function this assumes a Linux system and it's simply not used any more. Exit
	-2 means that the framebuffer wasn't init'd by the kernel. On BSD*
	and other *NIX this might be done differently...

2007-10-18  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* HACKING, NEWS, configure.ac: Splashy 0.3.7 begins The cycle starts here

2007-10-18  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* ChangeLog: new release 0.3.6 Splashy 0.3.6 is here

	* HACKING: make -j8 breaks build notes about -lsplashycnf link errors (ld) when using parallel builds
	(multiple make instances)

2007-10-16  Tim Dijkstra <tdykstra@commensaal.drs.p>

	* configure.ac, src/Makefile.am: Add d-c --libs to splashy_LDADD,
	this fixes the issue of building a properly linked dynamic and
	static version of libsplashy

2007-10-15  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* src/Makefile.am: order of library link was wrong -lsplashycnf must not be the first to link for splashy_config. This
	makes it "last" in the list

2007-10-15  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* HACKING: signed tags are needed

2007-10-15  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* ChangeLog: notes

2007-10-15  Luis Mondesi <lmondesi@zod.(none)>

	* ChangeLog: new notes

2007-10-15  Luis Mondesi <lmondesi@zod.(none)>

	* README: no more svn notes about sources from Git repo

2007-10-15  Luis Mondesi <lmondesi@zod.(none)>

	* HACKING: updated the release procedure we are using git now, which makes things a bit easier (and with less
	storage need)

2007-10-15  Luis Mondesi <lmondesi@zod.(none)>

	* ChangeLog: new release

2007-10-15  Luis Mondesi <lmondesi@zod.(none)>

	* NEWS, README: adds notes about moving themes to
	/usr/share/splashy/themes Ready to release

2007-10-03  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* ChangeLog: minor stuff added

2007-10-03  Tim Dijkstra <tdykstra@commensaal.drs.p>

	* configure.ac: Make configure.ac use pkg-config to pick up the
	correct path to the modules.

2007-10-03  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* scripts/lsb-base-logging.sh: do not complaint if tmpfs not mounted if user exits gdm, do not complaint about umounting the tmpfs we
	created and umounted during boot

2007-10-03  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* scripts/lsb-base-logging.sh: attempts to make Splashy exit faster do not check for things that are not necessary. just get out quickly

2007-10-03  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* scripts/default/splashy: use tty6 by default after Splashy exits tty6 should not have any weird messages and it will also work fine
	if gdm/kdm/xdm fails to start X

2007-10-03  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* scripts/default/splashy: switch to tty8 by default since this is a desktop, we default to a tty that has no text on it
	after Splashy is done. It should allow gdm/kdm/xdm to start and
	switch to tty7

2007-10-03  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* Makefile.am: create a symlink in /etc/splashy/themes ->
	/usr/share/splashy/themes this allows Splashy to work normally during shutdown (i.e. not
	running from initramfs)

2007-10-03  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* ChangeLog: getting ready to release

2007-10-03  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* scripts/default/splashy: run from initramfs by default now that we know what the problem with directfb was, we can set this
	to a sane default

2007-10-03  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* README: note on fixing keyboard event issue this should allow anybody to use init and directfb to start splashy
	from initramfs

2007-10-03  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* src/splashy_functions.c: disable console reading text the thread that reads messages from the console is buggy and not
	used. this code actually slows down Splashy and causes SEGV and ABRT
	signals to be caught when exiting with ESC while in Splashy "test"
	mode. We need to revisit this feature later. splashy_update "text
	foo" should still work and allow users to send messages to the text
	overlay. F2 also works

2007-10-03  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* src/splashy_video.c: print debugging info when releasing get more information about what's being released when running in
	debug mode

2007-10-03  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* scripts/lsb-base-logging.sh: gets rid of tmpfs when done when done with Splashy, get rid of tmpfs if not in debug mode

2007-10-02  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* src/Makefile.am: adding -ldirectfb breaks the build process there does not seem to be a need to add -ldirectfb on Directfb 1.0.1
	from experimental

2007-10-01  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* NEWS: directfb 1.x supported Now we can say that we officially support dfb 1.x. Older version of
	the library still work fine (0.9.25 in particular)

2007-10-01  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* src/libglib-2.0.la: this file does not belong in Splashy ditto

2007-09-30  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* src/Makefile.am: cleanups removes old comments and added new (cleaner) ones

2007-09-30  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* src/Makefile.am: adds -static-libgcc option to gcc this avoids having a binary that cannot find pthread cancel calls
	from libgcc_s

2007-09-30  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* scripts/init.d/splashy: adds debug string add ways to know if splashy has been launched multiple times

2007-09-29  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* scripts/lsb-base-logging.sh: uptime is not available at times this makes sure that we always get the loadavergage readings during
	boot (in DEBUG mode)

2007-09-29  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* scripts/default/splashy: we need to switch to tty1 using "auto" is not a good default now. when gdm is not installed,
	we need to go back to tty1

2007-09-29  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* src/Makefile.am: put back the static compilation splashy works fine without being -static, however, if we are going
	to enable initramfs by default, then it's better to just keep the
	things in initrd to a minimun

2007-09-29  Luis Mondesi <lemsx1@gmail.com>

	* ChangeLog: new log new changes

2007-09-29  root <root@localhost.localdomain>

	* NEWS: rpm packages supported now we are able to support RPM packages

2007-09-29  root <root@localhost.localdomain>

	* src/Makefile.am: on Fedora we do not like -all-static helps the creation of Splashy packages for RPM-based systems. the
	directfb-devel package does not include the required .a files (or .o
	for that matter)

2007-09-29  root <root@localhost.localdomain>

	* splashy.spec: compiles on Fedora Core 7 RPM package is now built correctly. A macro in ~/.rpmmacros was
	needed to avoid  stupid warning: %debug_package %{nil}

2007-09-29  root <root@localhost.localdomain>

	* src/splashy_main.c: on Fedora gcc throws warn freopen() returns a FILE*. catch this

	a theme for Splashy
