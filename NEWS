Changes between 0.3.13 and 0.3.14
-------------------------------

Changes between 0.3.12 and 0.3.13
-------------------------------

 * adds default theme to initramfs so we can fall back in case of problems with 
   a newer theme
 * fixes font problem with libdirectfb
 * fixes LSB script issue that prevented some applications to install 
   correctly if Splashy was removed/missing (mysql server, etc...)
 * no major C changes, minor bug fixes

Changes between 0.3.11 and 0.3.12
-------------------------------

 * closes a number of bugs from bugs.debian.org/splashy which apply to other 
   distros also
 * fixes problems with uswsusp
 * fixes problems with kdm
 * no major C changes, mostly scripts

Changes between 0.3.10 and 0.3.11
-------------------------------

 * implements chroot() as a command passed from splashy_update
 * works better with resume-from-RAM/Disk when uswsusp is used from initramfs
 * suggests to run update-initramfs -u when a theme is changed with splashy_config
 * removes boot dependency argument $all from initrc script (for LSB)
 * turns off cursor in TTY consoles to avoid showing artifacts when X starts
 * other bug fixes

Changes between 0.3.9 and 0.3.10
-------------------------------
 
 * plenty of bug fixes (Thanks Niko Araya for helping us sort them out) (See ChangeLog)
 * Splashy works better with encrypted hard disk (LUKS) and getstring/getpass prompts early at boot
 * lots of bug/thinko fixes from John Hughes, for which we are very glad!
 * fixes issues with progress bar during shutdown (Thanks to Matthijs Kooijman)
 * lsb-base-logging.sh LSB functions are a bit more complete
 * clears TTYs properly whenever Splashy is about to exit
 * detects display managers better (gdm, kdm, xdm)

 KNOWN BUGS:
 * (debian/ubuntu) if the user uninstalls gdm/kdm/xdm but do not purge the package, Splashy
   waits for the calling of log_end_msg or log_daemon_msg which never happen, because
   these scripts attempt to detect whether they are the default display manager and
   exit without calling any LSB log_* functions. (Thanks blathijs for pointing this out)

Changes between 0.3.8 and 0.3.9
-------------------------------
 * hu translation added (Thanks Miklos Vajna)
 * br translation added (Thanks Amadeu Andrade Barbosa JÃºnior)
 * added more checks at initramfs to ensure Splashy can be started (Thanks Luca Capello)

Changes between 0.3.7 and 0.3.8
-------------------------------
 * Bug fixes: 
   - /etc/lsb-base-logging.sh now checks whether it should unmount $STEPS_DIR before doing so
   - /etc/lsb-base-logging.sh now checks whether it should start keymap.sh/console-screen.sh on
     debian systems
   - console-tools/config.d/splashy touches /dev/shm/splashy* files to signal lsb-base-loggin.sh
     that it needs to start a process like keymap.sh/console-screen.sh

Changes between 0.3.6 and 0.3.7
-------------------------------
 * all static build dropped in favor of shared libraries. If your distribution does not support 
   initramfs shared binaries, or you are using Splashy from a thin-client server, you will need 
   to re-enable static on your own. Please refer to configure.ac and src/Makefile.am
 * scrolls text during boot (splashy_update "scroll text to display")
 * splashy_update commands print_scroll is now just scroll. Same for its alias "TEXT_SCROLL->SCROLL)
 * splashy_update command clrprint is now just "clear"
 * adds verbose text when pressing F2 (again). This time is done using LSB scripts not reading 
   the console files (/dev/vcs*)
 * LSB script writes splashy PID to /var/run/sendsigs.omit which is used by /etc/init.d/sendsigs to
   killall5 all processes at shutdown/reboot. This tells the system to ignore killing splashy during
   shutdown/reboot.
 * adds international support. Translators needed! http://splashy.alioth.debian.org/i18n/
 * uses the real size of the screen and not that reported by the surface (Thanks to DeX77 
   from #frugalware for helping to get this fixed)

Changes between 0.3.5 and 0.3.6
-------------------------------

 * Documentation updates
 * Support for OpenSuSE/Fedora and other RPM-based systems
 * Splashy now works with Directfb 1.x
 * Splashy runs from initramfs under Init again (Thanks to RPath Linux and Directfb Dev Team) (upstart works just like before)
 * Themes are now in /usr/share/splashy/themes and a symlink from /etc/splashy/themes points to that location (See README for more)

Changes between 0.3.4 and 0.3.5
-------------------------------

 * Bug fixes

Changes between 0.3.3 and 0.3.4

Changes between 0.3.1 and 0.3.3 
-------------------------------

Changes between 0.3.0 and 0.3.1
-------------------------------

-------------------------------

  * Minor bug fix:
    - lsb-base-logging.sh needed RUNLEVEL to be defined always
    - splashy-update-progress-steps needed RUNLEVEL to be defined
    - splashy-update-progress-steps had a problem when scripts did not
      all log_end_msg before the progressbar reached 100%
    - creates /lib/splashy which is needed by our initrc scripts
    - adds a script to prevent console-screen.sh from running

Changes between 0.2.0 and 0.2.1
-------------------------------

  * Minor bug fix to allow compilation on 64bit platforms

    This function is defined in /etc/lsb-base-logging.sh
  * decomissioned splashy-init
  * experimental support for Splashy from initramfs. This is work in progress.
  * support for DirectFB 0.9.25 and up

Changes between 0.1.8 and 0.1.8.1
-----------------------------------

  * a number of (minor) bug fix
  * splashy_config -i option support archives like .tar.gz, .tar.bz or .tar
    and it checks the archive
  * /sbin/splashy can be used as /sbin/splashy_chvt: avoiding a dependancy 
    on chvt from console-tools

Changes between 0.1.7 and 0.1.8
-------------------------------

  * Support for theme schemas
  * Implements all usplash commands on the named pipe/fifo
  * Splashy now runs from initramfs (experimental)
  * Improved verbose mode, pressing F2 shows verbose as well as autoverbose
    mode after detecting errors on the console (/dev/vcs* buffers). Text
    now shows on a nice, overlay textbox.
  * splashy-init replaces all initrc scripts. Allows to quickly update the
    progressbar, detects when X11 is to be launched by gdm/kdm/xdm, among
    many features
  * Fully Linux Standard Base (LSB) compliance
  * Text messages can be printed to the screen (for system messages) (Thanks
    to Pat from Xandros.com for the patch)
  * Multi-threaded, creating a very smooth progressbar and text reading from
    the system consoles.

    line (a GUI will follow shortly).
  * Detects errors on consoles and falls back to verbose mode
