splashy (0.1.6) experimental; urgency=low
  
  [Luis Mondesi]
  * Edited previous changelog entry of 0.1.5 to fix the bug was close. We
    closed the wrong but by mistake. The right one is #314162.
  * debian/control.in:
    - Replace all depends for ${shlibs:Depends} since it's auto-generated;
    - Add build-dependency of libglib2.0-dev at least at version 2.0.1-2
      since it included the static library needed for our build;
    - Add build-dependency to use libdirectfb-dev at least at version 0.9.22
      since it included the static library needed for our build;
    - Add build-dependency on Perl because we need pod2man to generate man
      pages
    - Add build-dependency on libjpeg62-dev because libdirectfb-dev needs it
      but it's missing from its dependancy list
    - Add package splashy-themes
    - Add Suggests: for the splashy-themes package
    - splashy-themes package has no binaries
  * debian/control: updated likewise;
  * debian/rules: pod2man use to generate splashy man pages
  * debian/splashy-themes.install: 
    - themes we install. The default theme is installed together with 
      the splashy package, so no need to mention it here.
    - added debian4 and crux themes
  * debian/splashy.postinst:
    - smarter when editing grub files has been turned off until debconf question is set
    - /etc/rcS.d/S01splashy -> /etc/rcS.d/S02splashy because it needs
      mountvirtfs to run first.
  * Little build system cleanup
  * debian/splashy.install: since adding an extra package, cdbs puts sources
    in debian/tmp causing the system to fail. This corrects that problem.

  * debian/splashy.postinst:
